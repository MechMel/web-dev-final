                  I pioneered, and am continuing to manage the technical side of
                  the Teach Safely website. This website is designed to provide
                  businesses and high-school teachers with high quality training
                  material that they can use to teach their employees or
                  students how to safely use a range of wood working and
                  construction tools. This website hosts, administers, and
                  automatically grades the premade training lessons that the
                  website owners created, and then displays these results to the
                  associated business or high-school teacher. I built the
                  website using Vue.js and the serverless framework, and hosted
                  it on AWS. Eventually I ended making the project open source
                  and converting it into an ongoing Capstone project for
                  rotating teams of senior Portland State University students to
                  work on. I lead the first team, and we officially launched a
                  simplified but working version of the website. I am no longer
                  leading a capstone team, but I continue to help work with and
                  coordinate whatever PSU capstone team is currently developing
                  the website.

                  Axiom Hoist specializes in overhead crane maintenance and
                  inspection. They have recently become the largest overhead
                  crane maintenance company in Oregon. I've written two internal
                  apps for them to help with bidding and organization. I'm
                  hoping to start work on a third app for them shortly here.
                  These apps are currently proprietary of course, but shortly
                  here we hope to have them ready to take to market. Stay tuned.

                  Escape the Gloomer is a text adventure game available on
                  desktop, mobile, and Alexa. It is set in the Redwall universe,
                  and follows the adventures of an otter durring the book
                  Mossflower. I lead most of the Unity development for the game,
                  and also got the first build of the game working on Alexa.
