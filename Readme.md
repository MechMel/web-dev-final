# Melchiah Mauck's Website

The website is currently live at [https://mechmel.github.io/web-dev-final/](https://mechmel.github.io/web-dev-final/).

The only outside sources used are some images I gathered from past projects and employes, and the [Roboto font via Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).

If you want to try out this website on your local machine, good news, there's no extra installation required. Just download the repository, and open the index.html in your favorite browser.
